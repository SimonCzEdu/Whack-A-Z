# **_Whack-a-Z_**

Whack-a-Z is a concept for a rougelike/rougelite game. Its main goal is to demonstrate the basic concepts of a game that can be easily expanded. To set a cornerstone for the combat system, noise level system, timer system and inventory system. Those core elements then can be further expanded which will be discussed in detail in [Future Features](<#future-features>).

# User Experience (UX)

## User Expectations

 * As a user, I want to know the basic premise of a game
 * As a user, I want to have tooltips to better understand the UI
 * As a user, I want to have options to turn off some of the UI features
 * As a user, I want to have some kind of feedback to better understand the game
 * As a user, I want to be able to win and lose the game
 * As a user, when I win or lose I want to see feedback that the game ended
 * As a user, when the game ends I want to be able to restart it

## Wireframes

The wireframes for Whack-a-Z were produced in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com). Frames depict the first draft of the site concept look. Core concepts stayed the same for both the horizontal and vertical look of the site. Some changes occurred during development and were implemented on "as needed" basis.

## Site Structure

This project is a single-page site. Hence there is no need for navigation. There was no need for traditional header>main>footer as the site is modeled after game UI. With the use of JavaScript I was able to show and hide the content to the user (player) as needed. I also introduced a tooltip system based `onmousemove` that informs the player what UI elements are and what they intend to do.

## Design Choices

 * ### General design philosophy

    * Whack-a-Z's first design choice is that it is a simple concept for a larger game. It is not meant to have all the features that I plan it to have. It is meant to work as a stand-alone turn-based combat system with a basic inventory system. It is meant as a showcase that such a game concept is not only feasible but also easily expandable. It is intended as a first building block and a showcase of my abilities to design and program a game system.

    * The second design choice is to keep the scope of the project small but plan for future designs as it is being developed. Those designs can be found in [Future Features](<#future-features>). Due to the smaller scope of the project, only a basic visual style is introduced. There is no font choice and only basic styling of the elements is introduced. The look of the game would be refined at the end of the development cycle of the whole game.

    * The third design choice is that it is meant to be satirical/humorous in design. At this stage it will mainly manifest through the text and Gary's (the Zombie) design.

    * The fourth design choice is that the game is not supposed to tell the player what is going on EXACTLY. It is meant to present enough information through the tooltips and UI so that the player can play the game. But to understand it player needs to pay attention to the UI and combat log.

    * The fifth design choice is that there are 3 lose conditions and only one to win. 

  * ### Color Scheme

    * The color scheme was chosen and tested during development. It was not a focus of the project and is subject to change. The idea was to make the elements easily distinguishable and color-coded where needed. Most of that is visible in the combat log. Green color was used to show positive player actions (like successful hit), red for being hit by Gary, black for neutral when the player just waits, a blue for player misses (because you feel "blue" about it), and yellow when Gary missed.
    Gary's health bar is green, because zombie blood is green (according to games I have played anyway), player health bar is red (because of course it is) and the noise level is color blue... for no particular reason and is subject to change.

# Features

   ## Main Game Screen
   
   * As mentioned above Whack-a-Z is a single-page site. This page is the Main Game Screen (called index in the files). Inside that screen, some features are displayed throughout the whole game, and some are displayed with JavaScript when conditions for them to appear are met (i.e. Settings screen). Specific features will be listed below.

# Acknowledgments

The site was completed as a Portfolio 2 Project piece for the Full Stack Software Developer (e-Commerce) Diploma at the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/). As such I would like to thank my mentor [Precious Ijege](https://www.linkedin.com/in/precious-ijege-908a00168/), the Slack community, and all at the Code Institute for their help and support. 


Whack-a-Z is a concept of a game. The game I wish I can expand and flesh out in the future. I would like to thank Code Institute for the opportunity to take the first step on this journey.

I also would like to thank my wife Marta Furman for her help with the project and support. She tested the site, provided invaluable insight and inspired me every step.
