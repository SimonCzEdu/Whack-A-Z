# **_Whack-a-Z_**

Whack-a-Z is a concept for a site of a fictional windows-selling company. It is focused on showcasing layout, features and potential products. It is scalable and has great potential to be further developed based on user/customer feedback.

# Acknowledgments

The site was completed as a Portfolio 2 Project piece for the Full Stack Software Developer (e-Commerce) Diploma at the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/). As such I would like to thank my mentor [Precious Ijege](https://www.linkedin.com/in/precious-ijege-908a00168/), the Slack community, and all at the Code Institute for their help and support. 


Whack-a-Z is a concept of a game. The game I wish I can expand and flesh out in the future. I would like to thank Code Institute for the opportunity to take the first step on this journey.

I also would like to thank my wife Marta Furman for her help with the project and support. She tested the site, provided invaluable insight and inspired me every step.
